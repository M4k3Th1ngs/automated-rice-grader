<h1>Milled Rice Grain Grading Using Raspberry Pi With Image Processing and Support Vector Machines With Adaptive Boosting</h1>
Hi! As a computer engineering student, I discovered my passion of image processing and artificial intelligence. For my undergraduate thesis,
I decided to create a platform which grades a rice sample based on the provisions of the National Grain Standards for Milled Rice Grain (Philippines).
The project is built using Python and several dependencies: OpenCV and NumPy and will be run inside a Raspberry Pi with a visual interface.
This is a work-in-progress.
